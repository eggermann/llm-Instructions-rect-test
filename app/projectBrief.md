## Project Brief â€“ PromptPing.de

### Overview

**PromptPing.de** is a smart, daily-updated prompt hub designed for businesses to publish structured, RAG-style (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data for use in external or third-party LLM systems. The core idea is to allow companies to push their latest offerings, FAQs, or service information as up-to-date prompts that can be easily consumed by LLMs to answer customer queries accurately.

### Vision

Enable businesses to maintain conversational accuracy and relevance by letting LLMs access the freshest information via a daily-updated prompt stream. This empowers AI assistants or chatbots (even external ones) to provide real-time, on-brand responses.

## Features

- **Push Notifications**: Companies can push new information about their services/offers ("Angebote") daily.
- **RAG-style Prompt Hosting**: Upload semi-structured information chunks designed to be used by LLMs in retrieval-augmented setups.
- **Feed for External LLMs**: Secure, daily-refresh JSON or API endpoint for external LLMs to consume and embed in their chat context.
- **Searchable Prompt Archive**: Businesses can view and manage past prompt sets.
