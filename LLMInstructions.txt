• This project uses React Server Components with Next.js 14+
• Follow modular architecture (e.g., modules/user, modules/product)
• Split components by type: server/ vs client/
• Only use 'use client' when necessary
• Prefer static over dynamic rendering where possible
• All server-side logic should remain in server components or APIs
• Client components should not fetch directly from DB
